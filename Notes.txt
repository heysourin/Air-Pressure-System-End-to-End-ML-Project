*************Other Notes***************

1. "-r" in pip install: 'read', it reads every package mentioned in requirements.txt then install them.

2. egg-file: meta-data of all the dependencies.
            gets created while creating setup.py.

3. from setuptools import find_packages: finds all the packages in the file setup.

4. `-e .` in requirements.txt --> Editable mode --> You can directly run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`, it triggers 'setup.py' to run the 'find_packages()' function, that checks how many packages are installed or not.
